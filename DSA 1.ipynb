    "#### Ans. Python has four basic inbuilt data structures namely Lists, Dictionary, Tuple and Set. These almost cover 80% of the our real world data structures.\n",
    "#### Lists: Lists in Python are one of the most versatile collection object types available. The other two types are dictionaries and tuples, but they are really more like variations of lists.\n",
    "#### Dictionary: In python, dictionary is similar to hash or maps in other languages. It consists of key value pairs. The value can be accessed by unique key in the dictionary. \n",
    "#### Tuple : Python tuples work exactly like Python lists except they are immutable, i.e. they can’t be \n",
    "#### changed in place. They are normally written inside parentheses to distinguish them from lists (which use square brackets), but as you’ll see, parentheses aren’t always necessary. Since tuples are immutable, their length is fixed. To grow or shrink a tuple, a new tuple must be created. \n",

    "#### Ans. Data structures in Python that is user-defined; that is, users define them. These include Stack, Queue, Linked List, Tree, Graph and HashMap. \n",
    "#### Stacks – Stacks are linear data structures in Python. Storing items in Stacks is based on the principles of First-In/Last-Out (FILO) or Last-In/First-Out (LIFO). In Stacks, the addition of a new element at one end is accompanied by the removal of an element from the same end. The operations ‘push’ and ‘pop’ are used for insertions and deletions, respectively. Other functions related to Stack are empty(), size() and top(). Stacks can be implemented using modules and data structures from the Python library – list, collections.deque, and queue.LifoQueue. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Queue – Similar to Stacks, Queues are linear data structures. However, items are stored based on the First- In/ First- Out (FIFO) principle. In a Queue, the item that is least recently added is removed first. Operations related to Queue include Enqueue (adding elements), Dequeue (deleting elements), Front and Rear. Like Stacks, Queues can be implemented using modules and data structures from the Python library – list, collections.deque, and queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tree – Trees are non-linear data structures in Python and consist of nodes connected by edges. The properties of a Tree are one node is designated the root node, other than the root, every other node has an associated parent node, and each node can have an arbitrary number of children nodes. A binary Tree data structure is one whose elements have no more than two children.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linked List – A series of data elements joined together via links is termed as a Linked List in Python. It is also a linear data structure. Each data element in a Linked List is connected to another using pointer. Since the Python library does not contain Linked Lists, they are implemented using the concept of nodes. Linked Lists have an advantage over Arrays in having a dynamic size, with ease of inserting/deleting elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Graph – A Graph in Python pictorially represents a set of objects, with some object pairs connected by links. Vertices represent the objects that are interconnected, and the links that join the vertices are termed as edges. The Python dictionary data type can be used to present graphs. In essence, the ‘keys’ of the dictionary represent the vertices, and the ‘values’ indicate the connections or the edges between the vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HashMaps/Hash Tables – In this type of data structure, a Hash function generates the address or index value of the data element. The index value serves as the key to the data value allowing faster access of data. As in the dictionary data type, Hash Tables have key-value pairs, but a hashing function generates the key."
